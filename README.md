Just stumbled out of the theater and I still hear the crunch of popcorn under my feet like they're echoing in my skull. iHostage – wow, where do I even begin? It's like my brain went through a blender and decided to take a swim in adrenaline. One moment I'm in a smoky room with the crook negotiating through a 2001-era Nokia phone—man, he must’ve 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   directly through dial-up, like a decade stuck in rewind. And then, bam! Next second I'm 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the hero leap over something resembling my collapsing couch. 

> Man, theaters are louder than a barn during a thunderstorm. Makes you wonder if the sound tech was trying to wake up everyone who fell asleep the first half. Got the impression everyone just woke up at the same time when the hero screamed like he saw a spider as big as a sheepdog. And my back, ugh, those seats are made of ancient bricks. 

There’s this bit where the protagonist tries to disarm a bomb with exactly 2 minutes to go, a kitchen timer ticking down like my mom timing cookies. Guess he thought he's in an Easter egg hunt scene. Who writes these tense moments? Honestly, could've 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 the   at home in pajama pants, popcorn pot at the ready. But, then again, where's the festival of smeared butter and overpriced sodas in that, huh?

The script, though, let’s just say a sixth-grader with a flair for hyperbole might have written it. Scene where the villain monologues like he’s auditioning for a local play, I get it - they’re bad. But this was like listening to my uncle at Thanksgiving dinner, bragging about 1984. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for that alone – it’s a spectacle of unintentional comedy.  

> I swear there was this side character who must have been wandering through the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 set by accident. Like, they had a cattle prod pointed at his back, ensuring he'd stumble through his lines. All of it set in a town that’s got as much humanity as a chicken coop—dirty, claustrophobic, but oddly compelling.

Right, where was I? Oh yes, the lead actor, his face set like old concrete, totally un𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬able till a love interest waltzes in with all the charisma of wet grass. She topples his stone face with a single look—like my neighbor’s wife disarming his sternness with a pie. 

Don’t even get me started on the conclusion. It's a jigsaw puzzle thrown in the air with everyone doing their best to look lost and then calling it art. If someone told me the final scene was 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮ed during a lunch break with stale bagels standing as extras, I'd believe them. 

```
def broken_dialogue(scene):
    gibberish = [hero, villain, plot twist][scene]
    return gibberish  random.randint(1, 3)
```

That was weird, must’ve had another tab open. Anyway, gotta find somewhere to sit without crumbs. A seat that looks less like invasive mountain peaks and more like a patch of heaven.
